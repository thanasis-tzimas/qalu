# QALU - Quantum Arithmetic & Logic Unit
This is a repository containing the source files of my undergraduate dissertation "*Implementing a Quantum Arithmetic and Logic Unit using the Qiskit SDK*".

## Repository directory structure
- `docs`: LaTEx markup files (see [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md))
- `code`: Python code that I used to render the circuit diagrams, run experiments on the IBM Q system and test their correctness
